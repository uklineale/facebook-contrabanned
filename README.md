# Contrabanned
An app that gets around one form of Facebook censorship. Farily limited in capabilites currently.

## Reasoning
Although there are some forms of speech that should be silenced, I believe the answer to wrong speech is more speech, not censorship. History is oddBefore the Trump era, people on the left side of the political spectrum would be strongly opposed to oligarchic censorship. The about-face with Trump/Biden's lab leak theory is indicative of a much larger problem. The details don't matter; it proved what independent journalists have been saying for years: *the media no longer presents research but groupthink.* This is not a left or right thing. This is the political establishment's dog flexing its muscles. As we've been seeing for years, the political establishment does not have the citizens' best interest at heart. 

The news now judges the facts for us. The talking heads condemning the Crazies, and we aren't trusted to think for ourselves anymore. Bring back independent, fact driven journalism. Fact-based, independent journalism and evidence-based, heterodox thinking is the true watchdog on power. Its a fact of humanity that unconventional thinking lies at the fringes of the Crazy. Its a fact of cybersecurity that scanners (essentially well intentioned code censorship) have a high false positive rate.  Censorship of the Crazies leads to censorship of a vitally important section of information for the public: independent thought over maintream mediums. 

What if independent journalists had successfully publicly exposed [George W. Bush's lies about WMDs](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/15/defector-admits-wmd-lies-iraq-war)? Imagine the lives, the budget, and the devestation that would've save. Why did [Obama prosecute an absurd amount of whistleblowers](https://cpj.org/reports/2013/10/obama-and-the-press-us-leaks-surveillance-post-911/)?

#### Communication Breakdowns Lead to Less Progress on Important Issues 
The spirit of democracy is disagreeing vehemently with someone in one regard but working together on urgent issues you agree on. The underlying assumption is humble, good faith conversations without fear of censorship where all parties are assumed compassionate but misguided at worst. Ideally, there is no opponent other than harmful ideas. Intend to listen and learn, not condemn or convince. Of course, legitimate hate speech can get the fuck out. If we can communicate, we can solve any issue. Without it, we will find less common ground and [make less progress on issues you actually care about.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/03/do-the-koch-brothers-really-care-about-criminal-justice-reform/386615/)

#### Democracy is disagreement without violence. 
Polarization leads to violence; unfortunately polarization sells. A company like Facebook that eagerly spoonfeeds us videos of armed militias from the Rabble (right wing Neo-nazis or BLM/Antifa extremists) of the Other Side to inform our opinion of that group can not be trusted with the power of censorship. Algorithms are siccing us on each other like we're caged dogs, too busy fighting to notice that the political establishment threw us in this cage to begin with. They narrow our attention to our daily constroversy, the daily heretic. [We become what we behold](https://ncase.itch.io/wbwwb).


Since smear campaigns are the MO of divisive media, I'd like to clarify my personal views. For those people that assume holding one view must imply other, unrelated sets of views, get out of your bubble.
- I am not advocating for unrestrained free speech on social media platforms. Hate speech, encouraging violence, doxxing, child pornography, non-consensual nudity are some of the things that I believe should be moderated. 
- I do not think social media censorship infringes the First Amendment. The First Amendment only stops government from censoring speech, not private companies. They are well within their rights. I only believe that censorship is harmful for democracy, and power creeps like tendrils around a tree.
- I do not condone any of the views this site may be used to dispense.
