# Contra-banned

Contra-banned is a selective redirect server that can circumvent Facebook's post censorship algorithm. 
If you don't believe in free speech for people you disagree with, you don't believe in free speech at all.
I probably don't agree with the things this service may be used for, but I disagree with censorship more strongly.
